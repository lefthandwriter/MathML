# MathML
Some notes I wrote while preparing for finals of ECE8843 - Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning.

I took this course in Fall 2017.

These notes would normally be handwritten and sit on a dusty shelf, but I took leisure at writing this one out.

The original course notes can be found here:
